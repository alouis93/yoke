# yoke
Twitter Clone built in Meteor.js

## Setting Up

- If you do not have [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/), install by running: 

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
- `cd` into the `yoke` directory and run: `meteor`

 
## Design and Implementation

- Yoke is a stripped down reimagining of Twitter with a focus on the content, so as to be used internally in group settings.
- Yoke aims to provide a single-page application experience, and as such the project is organized into modules, and localized event handlers and template helpers. 
- Built in Meteor.js using Handlebars.js, SASS and Mongo DB.
- Testing done using Mocha in cohesion with Velocity - the Meteor test runner.
